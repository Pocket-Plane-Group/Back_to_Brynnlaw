# Back_to_Brynnlaw
A Questmod for Baldur's Gate II (BGII, BGT, BGII:EE, EET)

Back to Brynnlaw MOD for Baldur's Gate II is an add-on for the game Baldur's Gate II, with or without the Throne of Bhaal expansion pack. The mod takes place in Chapter 6, when a messenger finds you next to the Adventurer's Mart.

It is highly recommended to take Imoen with you, though the mod works fine without her. Xan BG2 NPC also has extensive crossmod content with the mod.
