1. Introduction
----------------

Back to Brynnlaw MOD for Baldur's Gate II is an add-on for the game Baldur's
Gate II, with or without the Throne of Bhaal expansion pack. The mod takes
place in Chapter 6, when a messenger finds you next to the Adventurer's Mart.

It is highly recommended to take Imoen with you, though the mod works fine
without her. Xan BG2 NPC also has extensive crossmod content with the mod.

----------------
2. Installation
----------------

Windows:
--------

Make sure that you have obtained and installed the latest official Bioware patch.
Install the official patch BEFORE installing any unofficial modifications.

Do you want to restore a clean installation of Baldur's Gate II in mere seconds?
Then backup dialog.tlk, chitin.key, baldur.ini, bgmain.exe and override
directory BEFORE installing any mods.

This way, you can restore your "clean install" by deleting weidu.log and
override directory, and restoring all backups.

Make sure that Baldur's Gate II or ANY game-related utilities are not running.

To install the mod, unpack it in your game directory and run
Setup-BackBrynnlaw.exe.

To reinstall or uninstall the mod, run Setup-BackBrynnlaw.exe in your
Baldur's Gate II directory.


Mac OS X:
---------

If the mod was previously installed, uninstall it before extracting
the new version.

To install, simply extract the contents of the mod into your BG2 folder.

Setup-BackBrynnlaw, and Setup-BackBrynnlaw.command in your BG2 folder.

To install, simply double-click Setup-BackBrynnlaw.command
and follow the instructions on screen.

In case of difficulties:

1. Open the Terminal, type 'chmod +x' followed by a space, drag 
Setup-BackBrynnlaw.command into the window, press enter.
2. Type 'chmod 755' followed by a space, drag Setup-BackBrynnlaw
into the window, press enter.
3. Double-click Setup-BackBrynnlaw.command,
the installation process should now proceed.

To reinstall or uninstall the mod, run Setup-BackBrynnlaw.command

3. Frequently Asked Questions
------------------------------

Q: When and where does the mod begin?
A: Chapter 6, Athkatla, Waukeen's Promenade, a cloaked woman near
the Adventurer's Mart.
Q: But she is not there!
A: Make sure that you have actually installed the mod. Open your game directory
and run Setup-BackBrynnlaw.exe. If this file is not there, repeat 
the installation process as described above.

Q: What is this mod about?
A: You meet a rogue Cowled Wizard and set out with him to help another victim
of Irenicus' experiments. Of course, the Cowled Wizards are not too happy about
that, and in the meantime, the victim has her own plans... 

On the way, you get ten subquests and four new nice magical items.

Q: Are there recycled areas?
A: Yes.
Q: But it means the mod will suck!
A: No.

Q: How many areas shall we visit?
A: Brynnlaw, including the indoor areas, and Spellhold, including two levels
of the asylum. The maze is not included.

Q: How big is this mod?
A: It is smaller than your average BG2 stronghold quest, but the subquests will
keep you busy. It's about 2/3 of The Sellswords or Assassinations.

Q: Will we meet Desharik again?
A: Not him, no, but you'll meet some old faces - Lady Galvena from Brynnlaw and
Sion and Ketta from the Temple District come to mind.

Q: What about NPC interactions? Crossmod content?
A: Imoen has three conversations with PC and a few interjections, but
every other Bioware NPC has an interjection, too. Xan BG2 NPC also has
conversations for this mod. 

If you're a modder, feel free to add crossmod content for your characters.

Q: Is this mod compatible with mod X? 
A: It should work fine with other mods.

Q: When should I install it?
A: Together with Dungeon Crawl or Assassinations or other small quest mods
is fine.

Q: I am in the middle of my game, can I install it over and continue playing?
A: Yes, you can. Make sure the game is not running as you install it, though.

Q: Does it mess other potential mods that may work with Brynnlaw?
A: No, it doesn't. All area files have been copied and given new names, so
Back to Brynnlaw mod does not cause conflict. The mod's size is still small.

Q: There was an unfinished Pocket Plane mod called Blades of Brynnlaw...
A: Yes, but it was not fully playable. I wanted to finish it, but ultimately
decided that I wanted to tell my own story. Back to Brynnlaw is this story.

Q: I have a problem with one of the quests.
A: Check your journal and the walkthrough section of the Readme.

Q: What if I kill the wrong person? How shall I come back to Athkatla?
A: Talk to Sion and Ketta in the shop. They will teleport you.
